							<![CDATA[ <span style="font-family: Times; font-size: medium">Kate Russell is a journalist and reporter who, by her own admission, spends far too much time online. For the past decade she has dedicated her life to staying on top of online developments, commenting on the Internet, social media and mobile apps for the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and a frightening number of print and online publications. In that time she has seen a lot of things done well - but less widely reported are the disasters she's witnessed. From monumental social media screw-ups (like the Facebook party invitation that ended in a full-scale riot), to the truth behind how much information you're giving to 'The Man'. This revealing talk is not for the faint-hearted and might make you think twice about how well you know the Internet.</span> ]]>
