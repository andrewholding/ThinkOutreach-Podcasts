							<![CDATA[ <p>Sense About Science is a small charity that equips people to make sense of science and evidence. It supports and encourages scientists to speak out in public debates on scientific issues. Sile joined Sense About Science in February 2009 after a career as a stem cell researcher. As Public Liaison, she is concerned with the use of evidence in civic society and she also coordinates the libel reform campaign. Sile talks about why scientists, medics, editors and bloggers took on England's unfair and outdated libel laws and how they got the Government to pledge to protect our right for free speech.</p> ]]>
